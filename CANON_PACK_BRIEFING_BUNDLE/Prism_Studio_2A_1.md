  THE STAGE — Top, full width, 80px. The LED strip rendered live at the playhead. Not a widget. Not a thumbnail. The actual output. It's beautiful enough to
  watch on its own. Fixed — never scrolls, never hides.

  THE FIELD — Centre, dominant. Your main workspace. Time runs left to right. Energy runs bottom to top. Moments sit as blocks. The energy contour is a drawable
   mountain range — peaks are drops, valleys are breakdowns. Song structure detected by Trinity glows as coloured regions behind your work.

  THE MIXER — Left sidebar, collapsible. Eight vertical faders for the eight primitives. Live controls. Move them during playback and your gestures are recorded
   as automation. Below: material swatches.

  THE SCOPE — Right sidebar, collapsible. A radar chart of the 8 primitives at the current playhead. Below it: the zone map (concentric rings). Below that: AI
  emotional reading in plain English. "Building tension — compressed centre glow, cold crystalline, rising pressure."

  THE WAVEFORM — Thin strip below the Field. Audio waveform for navigation. Beats as tick marks. Sections as coloured bands. Energy curve ghosted on top.

  THE INTENT BAR — Bottom, always visible. Type or speak. Natural language becomes light. Transport controls on the right: Play, Stop, Loop.

  II. THE EIGHT PRIMITIVES

  These are not parameters. They are physical sensations. The creator never sees "brightness: 0.78" — they feel pressure.
  Primitive: PRESSURE
  What it feels like: Energy being contained. A balloon about to burst.
  What it controls: Density, saturation, compression toward centre. High pressure = tight, vivid, coiled. Low = diffuse, breathing, loose.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: IMPACT
  What it feels like: A fist hitting a wall. The kick drum in your chest.
  What it controls: Shockwave radius, attack speed, decay time. How hard light punches outward from centre on a transient.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: MASS
  What it feels like: Heavy vs weightless. Elephant vs hummingbird.
  What it controls: Motion speed, band thickness, colour depth. Heavy = slow, thick, deep. Light = fast, thin, bright.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: MOMENTUM
  What it feels like: Energy carrying forward between beats. A freight train vs a bouncing ball.
  What it controls: Inter-beat decay. High = light never fully settles. Low = each beat starts from darkness.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: HEAT
  What it feels like: Emotional temperature. Arctic vs volcanic.
  What it controls: Colour temperature and saturation character. Cold = blue-white, crystalline, brittle. Hot = amber-red, molten, fluid.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: SPACE
  What it feels like: How much room the light takes up. Intimate whisper vs arena flood.
  What it controls: Active LED range from centre. Intimate = just the centre 20 LEDs glowing. Vast = all 320 edge-to-edge.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: TEXTURE
  What it feels like: Grain. Smooth silk vs rough sandpaper.
  What it controls: Noise amount, flicker, granularity. Smooth = solid washes. Rough = particulate, flickering, alive with interference.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Primitive: GRAVITY
  What it feels like: Which way energy flows. Collapsing inward vs exploding outward.
  What it controls: Direction of motion. Inward = imploding. Outward = detonating. Zero = suspended, hovering.
  The creator thinks: "The intro should feel cold, tight, and heavy — like something enormous is waking up."
  They push: Heat down, Pressure up, Mass up, Space down.
  The light responds: a compressed, deep-blue centre glow that throbs slowly, barely moving. Exactly right.

  III. THE LOOP

  1. IMPORT — Zero to something in 15 seconds

  Drop a track. A waveform unfurls across the Field. Trinity analyses in the background — beats, sections, energy, stems, emotion. Within 15 seconds, the Field
  populates: section blocks appear (Intro, Build, Drop, Break, Drop 2...), the energy contour auto-generates from the audio analysis, and the Stage starts
  playing a "first draft" — an AI-generated show using the detected structure.

  You haven't touched anything and it already looks good.

  The Magic Draft isn't the destination. It's the starting gun. It shows you what's possible so you can say "yes, but MORE" or "no, colder" or "the drop needs
  to hit harder."

  2. DRAFT — Sculpting the energy

  You work in the Field. Three ways to shape your show:

  Draw — Grab the energy contour and reshape it. Pull the drop peak higher. Dig the breakdown valley deeper. The freehand tool feels like sketching — quick,
  loose, expressive. The Stage updates live as you draw.

  Place — Click a section block (a "Moment"). Assign it a material. Set its primitive values using the Mixer faders or the Scope's radar chart. Each Moment has
  a personality: "The intro is Ice. The buildup is Smoke becoming Magma. The drop is Magma shattering into Neon."

  Speak — Type into the Intent Bar: "The snare roll should feel like a pressure cooker about to blow." The AI adjusts the Pressure and Space curves for that
  section. Accept, reject, or adjust. Every suggestion is a diff you control.

  3. REHEARSE — Watch your creation breathe

  Hit Play. The song starts. The Stage comes alive. The Mixer faders dance with your automation. You watch your show as a continuous experience for the first
  time.

  Something's off at 1:47 — the transition into the second buildup feels too abrupt. Press M to drop a marker. Keep watching. The drop at 2:12 is glorious. The
  outro trails off nicely. Stop.

  Jump to the marker at 1:47. Fix it. Play from 1:40 to check. Perfect. Delete the marker.

  The rehearse loop is: watch → mark → fix → watch again. Fast enough that you do it 10 times before you're happy.

  4. PERFORM — Become the instrument

  Switch to Perform Mode. The Mixer faders unlock for live input. The song plays. You ride the faders.

  During the buildup, you physically push Pressure up while pulling Space down. You're compressing the light with your hands. At the drop, you slam Space wide
  and spike Impact. The light detonates. Your muscle memory from listening to this song a thousand times becomes the automation data.

  Every fader movement is captured. When you stop, PRISM asks: "Keep this performance?" You can accept it as-is, layer it on top of your existing automation, or
   cherry-pick sections.

  If you have a Tab5 encoder: eight physical knobs mapped to the eight primitives. Tactile. No screen needed. Pure feel.

  5. PUBLISH — Share the light

  To device — One click compiles to ShowBundle and pushes to your Lightwave. Test it on real LEDs.

  To video — Render a 30-second clip of your best section with the Stage preview at 4K. Optimised for Instagram Reels / TikTok. The video IS the marketing.

  To community — Upload your ShowBundle to the PRISM gallery. Others can download it, remix it (with attribution), or use it as a starting point for their own
  version.

  To performance — Generate a "setlist" of multiple shows for different tracks. Link them. Cross-fade between songs. You're now a VJ with a curated show.

  ---
  IV. TEN "HOLY SHIT" FEATURES

  1. The Impulse Stamp

  Tap the spacebar to the beat during playback. Each tap stamps an impact event at that moment. If your trackpad or keyboard supports pressure sensitivity,
  harder taps = bigger impacts.

  In 30 seconds of tapping along to a song, you've created the entire rhythmic skeleton of your show. No timeline editing. No dragging blocks. Just feeling the
  music and tapping.

  The first time a user does this and sees the Stage light up in sync with their taps, they will never use another tool the same way again.

  2. Material Physics

  Materials aren't colour presets. They have behaviour.

  - Magma: Flows slowly. Pools in the centre. Cracks and glows at impact points. Cools to dark crust between beats.
  - Ice: Crystalline and brittle. Shatters on impact — fragments scatter outward and fade. Reforms slowly between beats.
  - Neon: Buzzes and flickers. Strobes at high impact. Bleeds colour at the edges. Has "warmup" and "burnout" micro-animations.
  - Silk: Ripples and billows. Reacts to Gravity — flows toward the gravity direction like fabric in wind.
  - Void: Negative space. Actually dims surrounding LEDs. Creates holes in other materials. The absence of light as a creative tool.
  - Chrome: Mirrors and reflects. Picks up colours from adjacent zones. Shifts spectrally when it moves, like oil on water.

  The drop isn't "red at brightness 1.0." It's "molten steel hitting cold water."

  3. The Pressure Cooker

  During a buildup, grab the Space fader and squeeze it down. The light compresses toward the centre — getting denser, brighter, tighter. Hold it.

  The system tracks how long you've been compressing and how much energy is stored.

  At the drop, release. The light EXPLODES outward with force proportional to how long you held it compressed. The physics are real — release energy equals
  stored compression energy. Hold for 2 bars: solid burst. Hold for 16 bars: apocalyptic detonation.

  This single interaction — squeeze and release — captures the entire emotional arc of a buildup-to-drop in one gesture.

  4. Emotional X-Ray

  Toggle a view mode where the Field shows the AI's emotional reading of the music as a translucent colour layer behind your energy sculpture.

  Where your show aligns with the music's emotion, the colours blend harmoniously. Where they diverge, a subtle amber glow appears at the boundary.

  "The music is screaming EUPHORIA here, but your show reads as TENSION."

  This isn't prescription. Some of the best creative choices are deliberate contrasts — a cold, restrained light during a hot drop can be devastatingly
  effective. The X-Ray shows you what the music is feeling so you can choose how to respond. Agree with it. Contradict it. Subvert it.

  5. The Time Microscope

  Pinch-zoom into any moment and the Field smoothly transitions:

  Section level → you see the whole song as 6-8 blocks.
  Bar level → you see individual bars within a section.
  Beat level → you see quarter notes. Each beat's impact is a separate sculpt-able event.
  Sub-beat level → you see the anatomy of a single kick drum hit. How fast does the shockwave expand? What's the attack curve? Does it ring, snap, or splatter?
  Does it leave a luminous ghost that fades over 50ms?

  Zoom back out. That micro-sculpted moment plays seamlessly in the macro show. The same show works at every magnification — from 3-minute overview to
  10-millisecond forensics.

  6. Sympathetic Resonance

  When you sculpt the first Drop, the second Drop pulses gently in the Field. They're musically similar. The system knows.

  Finish your work on Drop 1. A quiet prompt: "Drop 2 is structurally similar. Inherit this treatment?"

  One click: Drop 2 absorbs the same material, energy contour, and primitive curves — with micro-variations so it doesn't feel robotic. The second drop is the
  first drop's louder, older sibling.

  Or reject it. Make Drop 2 something completely different. The system remembers your choice and stops suggesting inheritance for that pair.

  It's not copy-paste. It's "these moments are cousins. Should they look like family?"

  7. The Ghost Layer

  Press G to summon the Ghost. A translucent version of your show from a previous state appears behind your current work.

  Scrub the Ghost timeline: see what the drop looked like 5 minutes ago. 20 minutes ago. Before you changed the material. Before you redrew the energy contour.

  See something you liked better? Reach into the Ghost and pull it forward. Drag the Ghost's drop into your current show. Selective time-travel for creative
  decisions.

  The Ghost isn't undo. Undo is linear. The Ghost lets you cherry-pick across your entire edit history — take the drop from version 3, the buildup from version
  7, and the outro from version 1.

  8. Breath Mode

  Put your hand flat on the trackpad. Breathe.

  PRISM reads the subtle pressure changes of your breathing through the trackpad's force sensor. Inhale: Space expands, light diffuses outward. Exhale: Space
  contracts, light gathers inward.

  Hit record. Play the breakdown. Breathe with the music.

  Your show literally breathes with you. The breakdown section rises and falls with your lungs. It sounds absurd. It feels transcendent. The most intimate
  sections of a show become as personal as a heartbeat.

  Advanced: map breathing to any primitive. Breathe Pressure during the buildup. Breathe Heat during the outro. Your body becomes the automation controller.

  9. The Arena

  Press A to enter The Arena — a 3D preview environment.

  Your LED strip sits inside a virtual room. Toggle between:

  - Bedroom — close walls, warm ambient light, your desk visible. Intimate scale.
  - Studio — mid-size room, dark walls, monitors flanking the strip. Working scale.
  - Club — DJ booth POV, haze in the air, bass-vibration camera shake synced to your Impact events. The Strip is mounted behind the decks and the virtual crowd
  sees it.
  - Stadium — the Strip is 30 metres wide. Pyrotechnics fire on Impact spikes. Lasers trace your Gravity direction. The crowd is 50,000 strong.

  The same show. Four contexts. You see how intimate decisions play at stadium scale and how stadium-scale gestures feel in a bedroom.

  10. The Handoff

  Place multiple Lightwave devices in The Arena's 3D space. Each gets its own output.

  Draw a connection line between two devices. A single gesture creates a cascade: the drop hits Device 1 first, then ripples to Device 2 200ms later, then
  Device 3 400ms later. A wave of light sweeps across the physical room.

  Or: set them to counterpoint. When Device 1 explodes outward, Device 2 implodes inward. Push and pull across space.

  Or: unison. All devices hit simultaneously. The room becomes a single, synchronised instrument.

  The room itself becomes the canvas. Not one strip of light — a constellation of them, choreographed in space and time.

  V. THE PHILOSOPHY

  The entire system is built on one belief:

  The person who feels the music most deeply should be the one who makes the best light show — regardless of their technical skill.

  Every design decision serves this:

  - Primitives are sensations, not parameters. You don't need to know what "saturation" means. You know what "heat" feels like.
  - The first draft is automatic. You start by reacting, not constructing.
  - Performance is creation. Your body — your tapping, your fader rides, your breathing — becomes the source material.
  - AI is a collaborator that speaks your language. "Make it heavier" is a valid instruction.
  - The output is shareable in 30 seconds. The creation loop never stalls at "export."

  This isn't a tool for lighting engineers. It's a musical instrument that outputs light instead of sound. And like any great instrument, the ceiling is
  infinite but the first note is immediate.

  That's the cockpit. Where do you want to go deeper?


### Addendum 

## MODE: EXPLORATION — Savant Loop Harvest (Gold / Silver / Lead / Missing) + Redirect

Here’s the honest read: **this is a *killer* first “unconstrained” pass.** It’s not architecture. It’s *instrument design*. It made PRISM feel like a cockpit you’d actually want to live in.

Now we do exactly what you said: **observe, harvest what’s real, ignore the rest, then redirect.**

---

## 1) GOLD — keep these, they’re core to the dream

These are the ideas that instantly make SpectraSynq feel inevitable:

**G1. The Stage as a fixed, always-live strip preview**
“Output is always visible” is a *non-negotiable* UX law for an instrument.

**G2. The Field = time vs energy with “Moments” blocks**
This is a genuinely new authoring metaphor: not a DAW clone, but still musically intuitive.

**G3. The 8 “primitives as sensations”**
Pressure/Impact/Mass/Momentum/Heat/Space/Texture/Gravity is the right kind of abstraction. It’s “DJ language,” not “lighting engineer language.”

**G4. The Loop (Import → Draft → Rehearse → Perform → Publish)**
That loop matches how creators actually work: draft fast, refine, then *perform the last 10%* with your body.

**G5. Perform mode + automation capture (especially with Tab5 knobs)**
This is the strongest bridge you’ve got: “my muscle memory becomes the show.”

**G6. Impulse Stamp (tap-to-place impacts)**
This is huge. It gives people a “first win” in 20 seconds.

**G7. Pressure Cooker gesture (compress → hold → release)**
This maps perfectly to build/drop psychology. It’s a signature interaction.

**G8. Time Microscope (zoom from sections → bars → beats → sub-beat)**
This is *exactly* what makes it feel like a real creative tool rather than a preset picker.

**G9. Sympathetic Resonance (“moments are cousins”)**
This is a high-leverage workflow accelerant that doesn’t steal authorship.

**G10. Ghost Layer (non-linear creative undo/history)**
Not required day-1, but it’s a *legit* creator feature—not a toy.

---

## 2) SILVER — great concepts, but need grounding / trimming

These are valuable, but they’ll either become scope traps or require a tighter definition:

**S1. Materials with physics (Magma/Ice/Neon/etc.)**
Love the vibe. But it needs a translation layer: materials should map to a small set of render behaviours, not become a parallel engine.

**S2. Emotional X-Ray**
Potentially powerful *as a “mirror,” not a judge.* Needs careful UX so it doesn’t become “AI says you’re wrong.”

**S3. Arena (3D contexts: bedroom/club/stadium)**
Very inspiring. But likely “later.” If you keep it, make it a *single* useful context first: “club booth POV.”

**S4. Handoff / multi-device cascades**
Awesome endgame. Not MVP. Keep as “vision trailer” feature.

**S5. Right-side “Scope” radar chart**
Cool, but might be redundant if the primitives already have faders + per-Moment values. Could become visual noise.

**S6. “Trinity analyses in 15 seconds” claim**
This is fine as *a product promise*, but operationally it’s ambiguous. In this strategy, we don’t punish Opus for hand-waving—just flag it as “needs a concrete mode later.”

---

## 3) LEAD — discard or quarantine as “fun later”

These are either gimmicks or risky distractions:

**L1. Breath Mode via trackpad sensors**
Cute, but not foundational. This is “demo magic,” not core workflow.

**L2. Stadium scale + pyros + lasers**
That’s hype video territory. Not PRISM Studio territory (yet).

**L3. “Always gorgeous” / “never scrolls” absolutism**
Good instinct, but the pixel-perfect UI rules aren’t the point. Don’t let Opus lock layout details too early.

---

## 4) MISSING — what it didn’t answer (the stuff that decides if this becomes real)

This is the important part. This is where we redirect Opus next.

**M1. What *is* a Moment, precisely?**
What properties does it hold (material + primitive curves + zone mask + effect family)? How does it nest (Moments contain cues?)?

**M2. How do primitives map to actual light behaviour?**
Right now primitives are poetic (good). But we need the next bridge:
“Pressure affects *which* parameters in *which* effect families?”
Otherwise it stays a mood-board.

**M3. Where do stems/layers live in the UI?**
You want kick/clap/snare/lead/bass/layers as assignable “audio references.” This response never shows how that overlays the Field.

**M4. How do users do precise editing without becoming engineers?**
Impulse Stamp is great. But how do I:

* align events, quantise, nudge, swing
* adjust attack/decay on a single hit
* apply “this curve to the whole build”
  without falling into knob soup?

**M5. Preview parity loop**
How does the user trust that Stage preview ≈ hardware? What’s the “send to device” loop and how are mismatches diagnosed?

**M6. MVP cut**
If you gave this to a team, they’d build half of it and ship none. We need the **smallest version that still feels like Mammoth.**
