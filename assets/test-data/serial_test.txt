SERIAL COMMANDS FOR LIGHTWAVE:

1. Basic Controls (from main.cpp):
   t - Toggle random transitions ON/OFF
   n - Next effect with transition
   
2. Try pressing these keys one at a time:
   - Press 't' then ENTER (enables random transitions)
   - Press 'n' then ENTER (next effect)

3. Use the physical encoders:
   - Encoder 0: Rotate to change effects
   - Encoder 1: Adjust brightness
   - Encoder 2: Change color palette
   - Encoder 3: Adjust animation speed
   - Encoder 4: Control intensity
   - Encoder 5: Control saturation
   - Encoder 6: Control complexity
   - Encoder 7: Control variation

Note: The serial menu system appears to be disabled in the build.
Only 't' and 'n' commands are available via serial.
