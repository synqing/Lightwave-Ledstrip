## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Start Simple**
Your first pattern doesn't need to be complex. A simple, well-executed effect is better than a complex, buggy one.

### **Audio First**
Always design your pattern around the audio response. The music should drive the visual experience.

### **Performance Matters**
Real-time constraints are non-negotiable. Profile early and optimize often.

### **Test Thoroughly**
Test your patterns with different music genres, volumes, and audio sources.

### **Share and Learn**
The K1 Lightwave community thrives on sharing. Don't hesitate to share work-in-progress patterns for feedback.
