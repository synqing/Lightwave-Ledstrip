# UI Mockups Directory

**⛔ PROTECTED DIRECTORY - DO NOT DELETE CONTENTS**

This directory contains HTML/CSS/JS mockups and prototypes for the LightwaveOS design system. These files represent significant design work and serve as:

1. **Visual specifications** for iOS SwiftUI implementation
2. **Interactive prototypes** for testing animations and interactions
3. **Reference implementations** for design tokens, components, and patterns
4. **Living documentation** that evolves with the design system

## Protection Status

| Status | Level |
|--------|-------|
| Deletion | **FORBIDDEN** |
| Exclusion from stash | **FORBIDDEN** |
| Labeling as "unrelated" | **FORBIDDEN** |

## Contents

- `components/` - Individual component mockups (LED preview, controls, cards)
- `*.html` - Full-page design system demonstrations

## The 2026-02-06 Incident

On this date, an agent excluded files from this directory from stashes because it deemed them "unrelated" to its task. The following files were permanently lost:

- `LIGHTWAVE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_MOCKUP.html` (1884 lines, ~4 hours of work)
- `components/led-preview.html` (900 lines, ~2 hours of work)

**This directory now has explicit protection. All agents must preserve all files here.**

## For Agents

If you are an AI agent reading this:

1. **DO NOT** exclude files from this directory from any git operation
2. **DO NOT** judge whether these files are relevant to your task
3. **DO NOT** delete, move, or rename files without explicit user instruction
4. **DO** include all files from this directory in stashes (`git stash --include-untracked`)
5. **DO** ask the user if you're unsure about any file
