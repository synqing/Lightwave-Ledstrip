# Motion Notes: beatPulse

- What animates: small circular pulse.
- Trigger: inputs `isBeating`, `isDownbeat`, `confidence`.
- Expected behaviour:
- Beat: quick scale-up then decay to rest.
- Downbeat: stronger scale and glow than regular beat.
- Confidence: drives opacity/strength.
- Resting state: small static dot.
