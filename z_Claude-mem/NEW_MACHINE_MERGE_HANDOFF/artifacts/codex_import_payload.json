Rationale: your panics were masking the real source by crashing in the coredump path; removing it exposes the actual faulting code. Outcome: coredump still attempted due to prebuilt Arduino SDK defaults, but the wraps stopped the earlier StoreProhibited-in-coredump crashes; later panics showed real app frames.\n\n- Removed in-loop Serial warning prints: The first real backtrace (after coredump overrides) showed a LoadProhibited in `Print::write` coming from `LGPVisualManager::updatePerformanceMetrics()` warning print. I removed that warning block and guarded against div-by-zero. Rationale: panic path proved Serial access (pointer) was bad; eliminating the print removed that crash source.\n\n- Guarded RMT writes: Latest panic was an abort triggered by our own `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` on `rmt_write_items` returning `ESP_FAIL` (legacy RMT driver error). I replaced the hard check with an error guard and a `rmt_fault` flag to stop retransmitting instead of aborting. Rationale: avoid self-induced abort so the system can stay alive and we can see if/when RMT fails.\n\n**Blockers encountered**\n\n1) Core dump still tries to run (Arduino ESP-IDF config has coredump to flash enabled, CRC error). Even with our flags, the prebuilt SDK prints \u201cCore dump flash config is corrupted!\u201d before reboot. Not fatal now, but noisy and still invoked.\n\n2) Legacy RMT driver errors driving 128 LEDs (64 per channel). `rmt_write_items` on channels 0/1 returns ESP_FAIL, causing the abort. The legacy driver struggles with large symbol counts; this is the current showstopper for stable LED output.\n\n3) Deprecated drivers (I2S, RMT) in use; warnings show the stack is on old APIs that may behave poorly on S3.\n\n**What likely needs to be done to resolve**\n\n- Eliminate Arduino coredump entirely: add `#undef CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENA",

      "facts": null,
      "narrative": "**Debrief**\n\n- Disabled core-dump writes: Added build flags to turn off coredump and added linker wraps (`--wrap=esp_core_dump_*`) with stubs so panics don\u2019t die inside coredump flash writes. Rationale: your panics were masking the real source by crashing in the coredump path; removing it exposes the actual faulting code. Outcome: coredump still attempted due to prebuilt Arduino SDK defaults, but the wraps stopped the earlier StoreProhibited-in-coredump crashes; later panics showed real app frames.\n\n- Removed in-loop Serial warning prints: The first real backtrace (after coredump overrides) showed a LoadProhibited in `Print::write` coming from `LGPVisualManager::updatePerformanceMetrics()` warning print. I removed that warning block and guarded against div-by-zero. Rationale: panic path proved Serial access (pointer) was bad; eliminating the print removed that crash source.\n\n- Guarded RMT writes: Latest panic was an abort triggered by our own `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` on `rmt_write_items` returning `ESP_FAIL` (legacy RMT driver error). I replaced the hard check with an error guard and a `rmt_fault` flag to stop retransmitting instead of aborting. Rationale: avoid self-induced abort so the system can stay alive and we can see if/when RMT fails.\n\n**Blockers encountered**\n\n1) Core dump still tries to run (Arduino ESP-IDF config has coredump to flash enabled, CRC error). Even with our flags, the prebuilt SDK prints \u201cCore dump flash config is corrupted!\u201d before reboot. Not fatal now, but noisy and still invoked.\n\n2) Legacy RMT driver errors driving 128 LEDs (64 per channel). `rmt_write_items` on channels 0/1 returns ESP_FAIL, causing the abort. The legacy driver struggles with large symbol counts; this is the current showstopper for stable LED output.\n\n3) Deprecated drivers (I2S, RMT) in use; warnings show the stack is on old APIs that may behave poorly on S3.\n\n**What likely needs to be done to resolve**\n\n- Eliminate Arduino coredump entirely: add `#undef CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENABLE` etc. via a custom `sdkconfig.h` override, or strip `libespcoredump.a`/provide full stubs for all exported symbols. Option: erase the coredump flash partition once and ensure bootloader/SDK don\u2019t try to parse it.\n\n- Move LED output to the new RMT TX driver (or use Arduino\u2019s `rmtWrite` helper) with a WS2812 encoder, or reduce/write in chunks. The legacy `rmt_write_items` path often fails with large buffers; switching APIs or chunking will remove the ESP_FAIL.\n\n- Sweep for any remaining Serial prints in hot paths that might dereference null/invalid Print targets during early boot/panic (current print culprit removed).\n\n**Summary of fixes applied (paths)**\n\n- `platformio.ini`: added coredump-off flags and linker wraps for coredump functions.\n- `core_dump_stub.cpp`: added linker-wrapped no-ops for coredump entry points.\n- `include_visual/lgp_visual_manager.h`: removed FPS warning prints; added safe avg calc.\n- `main.cpp`: guarded RMT writes, stop aborting on RMT failures.\n\nIf you want the next pass: I\u2019d switch to the modern RMT TX+WS2812 encoder (or Arduino `rmtWrite`), and hard-disable coredump at the SDK level so it never runs.",

FROM observations_fts WHERE observations_fts MATCH 'projectName'\"`) to verify the lessons/summaries are searchable, and keep a brief changelog of which directories/projects were mapped so the \u201chigh-value work\u201d catalog stays auditable.",

This is the most recent attempt: **Short Answer**\n- Not usually. StoreProhibited panics are almost always a null/invalid pointer write in code, not \u201cflash corruption\u201d.\n- Erasing flash can help if the crash is caused by a bad NVS/core-dump region or mismatched partitions, but it\u2019s a last resort after decoding and fixing the offending source line.\n\n**Recommended Order**\n- Decode the backtrace in the monitor to the exact file:line, fix the code.\n- If the panic keeps invoking the core dump writer (as your trace shows), disable core dump to stop SPI flash interaction during crashes.\n- Only then, if boot loops persist or NVS looks corrupt, do a full chip erase and reflash.\n\n**Disable Core Dump (prevents flash writes during panic)**\n- Edit `external_proven/platformio.ini` and add:\n  - `monitor_filters = esp32_exception_decoder`\n  - In `build_flags` add:\n    - `-DCONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENABLE=0`\n    - `-DCONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENABLE_TO_FLASH=0`\n    - `-DCONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_ENABLE_TO_UART=0`\n\n**Full Erase + Reflash**\n- `cd \"/Users/macbookpro/00. Dev/P4_Tab5_Visualizer/SS_AP_FULLBUILD/external_proven\"`\n- `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101 erase_flash`\n- `pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1 -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101`\n- `pio device monitor -b 115200 -p /dev/cu.usbmodem2101`\n\n**Why Erase Helps Sometimes**\n- NVS/core-dump partitions can hold stale state and coredump metadata that trips low-level flash routines during a panic.\n- A full erase clears partitions (NVS, core-dump, app slots) and ensures the next boot starts from a clean image and clean non-volatile storage.\n\n**What Your Trace Means**\n- Frames are inside `espcoredump` and `spi_flash` because the system is trying to write the crash dump when the exception happens; EXCVADDR `0x00000008` points to a null/near-null write.\n- After disabling core dump, the next crash will show your app\u2019s real offending function and line. Then we fix that code path instead of wiping flash blindly.\n\nIf you want, I can apply the core-dump disables in the config and give you a cleaned rebuild, then we decode the next crash and patch the exact source line. // Can you take over, investigate in detail, deploy all your tools, skills, mcps as required to get the job done. the device is ready for upload on usbmodem2101",

      "prompt_text": "# AGENTS.md instructions for /Users/macbookpro/Downloads/z_Claude-mem\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/macbookpro/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/macbookpro/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>",
